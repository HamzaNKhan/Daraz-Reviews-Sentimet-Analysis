# Daraz-Reviews-Sentimet-Analysis

## Tasks
* Data Scraping
I assigned a category for Daraz product i.e 'Skin Care'. I have scraped all products data (Product name, Product Price, Product Reviews)
that is given on the webpage. I have scraped minimum 4-5 pages data by automating the scraper to go to
next page automatically.

* Data Cleaning
After Scraping, I have cleaned the data, by removing extra spaces, Nan, Webpages addresses, emails and
invalid characters etc.


* Perform Sentiment Analysis
I have been provided with two files. i.e. Positive, Negative. After Scrapping and cleaning I have performed Sentiment analysis on that reviews by comparing positive 
and negative words from that file and assign the sentiment
accordingly. In the end, I took average of all reviews for same product and
assigning single sentiment.


## Python Libraries for scraping
I had used beautiful soup, and selenium for scraping.
